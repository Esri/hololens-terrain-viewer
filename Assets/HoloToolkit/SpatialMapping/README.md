## [SpatialMapping]()
Scripts that leverage SpatialMapping related features.

1. Enable the "SpatialPerception" capability in Player Settings -> Windows Store -> Publishing Settings -> Capabilities.
2. If using the RemoteMapping components, you will also need to set the InternetClientServer, PrivateNetworkClientServer, and Microphone capabilities. 

**IMPORTANT**: Please make sure to add the Spatial Perception capability in your app, in Unity under  
Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Settings for Windows Store -> Publishing Settings -> Capabilities  
or in your Visual Studio Package.appxmanifest capabilities.

### [Plugins](Plugins)
PlaneFinding addon that can be used to find planar surfaces (ie: walls/floors/tables/etc) in the mesh data returned by Spatial Mapping.

### [Prefabs](Prefabs)

The following prefabs make it easy to quickly access and visualize spatial mapping data in the HoloLens or in the Unity Editor.

#### RemoteMapping.prefab
Use with SpatialMapping prefab, it allows you to send meshes from the HoloLens to Unity and save/load the meshes for use later.

#### SpatialMapping.prefab
Base prefab which allows you to visualize and access spatial mapping data on the HoloLens. It can also save/load room models that were captured from the Windows Device Portal.

#### SurfacePlane.prefab
Helper prefab which should be referenced by the SurfaceMeshesToPlanes component for classifying planes as floor, ceiling, wall, etc during processing.

### [Scripts\SpatialProcessing](Scripts)

The following scripts allow you to process the raw spatial mapping data in order to find planes, remove vertices, etc.

#### PlaneFinding.cs
Unity script that wraps the native PlaneFinding DLL. Used by SurfaceMeshesToPlanes.cs.

#### RemoveSurfaceVertices.cs
A spatial processing component that will remove any spatial mapping vertices that fall within the specified bounding volumes.

**BoundsExpansion** The amount, if any, to expand each bounding volume by.

#### SurfaceMeshesToPlanes.cs
A spatial processing component that can find and create planes based on spatial mapping meshes. Uses PlaneFinding.cs and requires the PlaneFinding plug-in.

**ActivePlanes** Collection of planes found within the spatial mapping data.

**_SurfacePlanePrefab_** A GameObject that will be used for generating planes. If no prefab is provided, a Unity cube primitive will be used instead.

**MinArea** Minimum area required for a plane to be created.

**DrawPlanes** Bit mask which specifies the type of planes that should be rendered (walls, floors, ceilings, etc).

**DestroyPlanes** Bit mask which specifies the type of planes that should be discarded.

#### SurfacePlane.cs
Generates planes and classifies them by type (wall, ceiling, floor, table, unknown). Should be a component on the SurfacePlanePrefab used by SurfaceMeshesToPlanes.cs.

**PlaneThickness** How thick each plane should be.

**UpNormalThreshold** Threshold for acceptable normals. Used to determine if a plane is horizontal or vertical.

**FloorBuffer** Max distance from the largest floor plane before a horizontal plane will be classified as a table.

### [Shaders](Shaders)

#### Occlusion.shader
A basic occlusion shader that can be used to occlude objects behind spatial mapping meshes. Use SpatialMappingManager.SetSurfaceMaterial() to use this material with the spatial mapping data. If you want to create an occlusion 'window', a better shader to use is WindowOcclusion.shader.

#### Wireframe.shader
A basic wire frame shader that can be used for rendering spatial mapping meshes. Use SpatialMappingManager.SetSurfaceMaterial() to use this material with the spatial mapping data.

### [Tests](Tests)

#### PlaneFinding.unity
To use this sample code, load the PlaneFinding scene and hit Play. The PlaneFinding algorithm will run in a loop. Switch to the scene view to see a visualization of the planes found.
The PlaneFindingTest component exposes a couple of properties that let you manipulate the PlaneFinding API parameters in real-time and observe their impact on the algorithm.

NOTE: In the interest of simplicity, this test script calls the PlaneFinding APIs directly from the main Unity thread in Update(). 
In a real application, the PlaneFinding APIs **MUST** be called from a background thread in order to avoid stalling the rendering thread and causing a drop in frame rate.

#### RemoteMapping.unity
The RemoteMapping scene uses the SpatialMapping and RemoteMapping prefabs to send spatial mapping data between the HoloLens and the app running in the Unity editor.
To run this test, you must first open port 11000 on your firewall and then set the IPv4 address of your PC in the 'RemoteMeshTarget' and 'RemoteMeshSource' components.
You can then build and deploy to the HoloLens. Once you see the wireframe mesh appear in your HoloLens, press the 'play' button in Unity to run the app in Editor. Ensure that the 'Game view' has focus, and then press the 'N' key (RemoteMappingKey) to switch to using the network as the spatial mapping source in the Editor.
Once you are confident that you have a good mesh, say the 'Send Meshes' (SendMeshesKeyword) to send the meshes from the HoloLens to the Unity Editor.
Press the 'S' key (SaveFileKey) to save the mesh to your PC. Press the 'play' button to stop the app from running in the Unity editor. Now, press 'play' one more time to restart the app. This time, press the 'L' key (LoadFileKey) to load the mesh that you previously saved into the Editor.

#### SpatialProcessing.unity
The SpatialProcessing scene tests the two processing scripts available in HoloToolkit: SufraceMeshesToPlanes and RemoveSurfaceVertices. 
If running in the Editor, the ObjectSurfaceObserver will load the SRMesh.obj file set in the SpatialMapping object of the scene. If you don't already have a file, you can capture one from the '3D View' page of the Windows Device Portal.  If running on the HoloLens, real-world surfaces will be scanned. After 15 seconds, the meshes will be converted to planes. If a floor plane is found, the test will remove vertices from surface meshes that fall within the bounds of any active plane.

#### TapToPlace.unity
This scene is the minimum setup to use the TapToPlace script.  It includes GazeManager, GestureManager, and SpatialMapping prefab.  BasicCursor prefab is included for ease of use. There is a cube in the scene with TapToPlace added on it. Gaze at and tap the cube.  It will move along the spatial mapping mesh based on user's gaze. While the cube is in 'placement' mode, the spatial mapping mesh will be visible. When tap is performed again, the cube will be placed on the mesh and the mesh will no longer be visible.
