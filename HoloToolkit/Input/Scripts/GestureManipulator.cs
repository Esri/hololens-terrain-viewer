    /// When an active GestureManipulator component is attached to a GameObject it will subscribe
    /// to GestureManager's manipulation gestures, and move the GameObject when a ManipulationGesture occurs.
    /// If the GestureManipulator is disabled it will not respond to any manipulation gestures.
    /// 
    /// This means that if multiple GestureManipulators are active in a given scene when a manipulation
    /// gesture is performed, all the relevant GameObjects will be moved.  If the desired behavior is that only
    /// a single object be moved at a time, it is recommended that objects which should not be moved disable
    /// their GestureManipulators, then re-enable them when necessary (e.g. the object is focused).
